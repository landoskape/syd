# DataViewer Deployment Guide

## Overview

DataViewer is designed to be accessible to users of all skill levels while maintaining the flexibility needed for advanced use cases. This guide covers the different ways to deploy DataViewer applications and provides implementation guidance for each approach.

## Core Concepts

Before diving into deployment options, understand that every DataViewer application consists of:

1. Parameter definitions (what users can control)
2. Plot function (how data is visualized)
3. Deployment method (how users interact with the viewer)

## Deployment Options

### 1. Jupyter Notebook Integration
**Difficulty Level: 2/10**

The simplest way to use DataViewer. Perfect for data exploration and prototyping.

```python
from dataviewer import ViewerBuilder

viewer = ViewerBuilder()\
    .add_selection("dataset", ["A", "B"])\
    .add_float("threshold", 0, 1)\
    .build()

viewer.run_in_notebook()
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Special notebook renderer class
- IPython widget integration
- Automatic display handling
- Notebook-specific state management

### 2. Standalone Python Script
**Difficulty Level: 3/10**

Good for reproducible analysis and sharing with other Python users.

```python
# view_data.py
from dataviewer import ViewerBuilder

viewer = ViewerBuilder()\
    .add_selection("dataset", ["A", "B"])\
    .build()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    viewer.run()
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Command line tool for generating templates
- Project scaffolding utilities
- Clear entry points
- Error handling and logging

### 3. Web Application
**Difficulty Level: 3/10**

Ideal for sharing with non-technical users or deploying to servers.

```python
from dataviewer.web import create_web_app

viewer = ViewerBuilder()\
    .add_selection("dataset", ["A", "B"])\
    .build()

app = create_web_app(viewer)
app.run()
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Web server abstraction layer
- State management system
- Security considerations
- Static asset handling
- Deployment guides

### 4. Desktop Application
**Difficulty Level: 3/10**

Best for standalone tools and offline use.

```python
from dataviewer.desktop import create_desktop_app

viewer = ViewerBuilder()\
    .add_selection("dataset", ["A", "B"])\
    .build()

app = create_desktop_app(viewer)
app.run()
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Window management
- Native OS integration
- Installation packaging
- Update mechanism

### 5. Command Line Interface
**Difficulty Level: 3/10**

Useful for automation and scripting.

```python
from dataviewer.cli import CLI

viewer = ViewerBuilder()\
    .add_selection("dataset", ["A", "B"])\
    .build()

CLI(viewer).run()
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Argument parsing
- Progress indicators
- Terminal UI components
- Shell completion

## Making Deployment Easy

### 1. Project Templates

Provide templates for all deployment types:

```bash
# Command line tools
dataviewer create notebook
dataviewer create script
dataviewer create webapp
dataviewer create desktop
```

### 2. Consistent Interface

Use same building blocks regardless of deployment:

```python
# Core viewer definition stays the same
viewer = ViewerBuilder()\
    .add_selection("dataset", ["A", "B"])\
    .build()

# Just change how it's run
viewer.run_notebook()  # For notebooks
viewer.run_desktop()   # For desktop
viewer.run_web()       # For web
viewer.run_cli()       # For CLI
```

### 3. Configuration Files

Support YAML configuration for all settings:

```yaml
# config.yaml
viewer:
  parameters:
    - name: dataset
      type: selection
      options: [A, B]
  
deployment:
  type: web  # or notebook, desktop, cli
  settings:
    port: 8080
```

### 4. Interactive Builder

Provide GUI tool for viewer creation:

```python
from dataviewer.builder import interactive_build

viewer = interactive_build()  # Opens GUI builder
viewer.save("my_viewer.yaml")  # Save configuration
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Core Architecture

1. Separate viewer definition from deployment
2. Use dependency injection for platform-specific code
3. Implement common interface for all deployment types
4. Build robust state management system

### Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for viewer building
2. Integration tests for each deployment type
3. End-to-end tests for complete workflows
4. Performance benchmarks

### Documentation Requirements

1. Getting started guides for each deployment
2. Complete API reference
3. Example gallery
4. Troubleshooting guides
5. Deployment-specific tips

### Error Handling

1. Clear error messages for common issues
2. Graceful fallbacks when possible
3. Detailed logging for debugging
4. User-friendly error displays

## Development Roadmap

1. Phase 1: Core viewer functionality
2. Phase 2: Notebook and script deployment
3. Phase 3: Web deployment
4. Phase 4: Desktop and CLI deployment
5. Phase 5: Interactive builder and tools

## Security Considerations

1. Data handling and privacy
2. Web security for server deployment
3. File system access controls
4. Network security for remote data

## Performance Optimization

1. Caching strategies
2. Lazy loading
3. Data streaming
4. Resource management

Remember: The goal is to make every deployment option accessible to novices while maintaining the power and flexibility needed for advanced users.
